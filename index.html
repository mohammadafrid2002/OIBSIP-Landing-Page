            <h3>Automation On Light and Fan Based on Human Detection Using AI & IoT</h3>
           <p>In a world increasingly focused on energy efficiency and smart technology, our final-year project, "Automation of Lighting and Fan Control through AI and IoT," emerged as a beacon of innovation. This project aimed to transform how we interact with our environments, making them not only more convenient but also environmentally conscious. Our system leveraged the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an intelligent, autonomous solution for controlling lighting and fan systems. It all started with a camera-based human detection system. This camera could recognize the presence of people in a room or environment. Once a human presence was detected, our system seamlessly and instantaneously controlled the electricity, turning on or off lights and fans as needed. It ensured that rooms were illuminated only when necessary, reducing energy consumption, and contributing to sustainability efforts.</p>

            <h3>Prison Management System</h3>
           <p>The "Prison Management System" is a robust database project built on Oracle or MySQL, utilizing PHP as the programming language, and running on the XAMPP server. This system is designed to efficiently manage and organize data related to inmates, staff, and various prison operations. It enables secure data storage, retrieval, and management, simplifying administrative tasks, inmate records, and monitoring of prison activities. Through a user-friendly interface, prison staff can update and access information, ensuring smoother operations, reduced paperwork, and improved security. This project exemplifies the effective utilization of modern technology to enhance prison management, making the correctional system more organized and efficient.
